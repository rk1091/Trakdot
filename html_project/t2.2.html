<font face="calbri"size=2>Q. How does Trakdot™ work without GPS Tracking Technologies?
A. Trakdot™ employs newly patented mirco-electronics and ground-based cellular telephone technologies to track and report its position 
on the ground even while inside metal containers, such as cars, hardened suitcases, and parked aircraft.	

Q. When in luggage, in an airplane cargo hold, how does Trakdot™ comply with FAA regulations?
A. Trakdot’s artificial intelligence shuts off its transmit-and-receive capability and enters “airplane mode” by employing 
solid-state accelerometer technologies that sense the sustained acceleration of an airplane during taxi and/or the
 approximate first third of takeoff roll. Trakdot™ is in airplane mode or “sleep mode” well before the aircraft is airborne.

• Trakdot™ is FCC approved
• Trakdot™ is approved by Conformité Européenne (CE) for use in European Community
• Trakdot™ complies with FAA Advisory Circular 91-21.1B
• Trakdot™ was developed in consultations with the U.S. Radio Technical Commission
• Trakdot™ is completely international, and works wherever a GSM cellular network exists

Q. Once back on the ground, how does Trakdot™ turn itself back on and report where it is?
A. The same accelerometer technologies used to put Trakdot™ in sleep mode before aircraft flight, also sense the sustained deceleration of the aircraft
 as the pilot uses brakes and thrust reversers on the ground to rapidly slow the aircraft after it touches-down.When Trakdot™ is “re-awakened” on the ground,
 it finds and employs the local cellular network to contact the Trakdot™ owner and report its position.</font></pre>
